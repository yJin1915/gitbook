# The NEL Token

Nela's native token NEL, acts both as a utility token for users in the network and a store of value and incentive reward for resource providers. As such, maintaining a healthy economy that balances both supply of resources and demand for utility is one of the core components which will enable Nela’s success. The native NEL token plays a central role in Nela’s economy. Its utility is for the following:

1. Staking (as a resource provider or L2 bridge provider).
2. Gas and transaction fees for using Nela’s functionality.
3. Voting in the DAO mechanism.

_More information on Nela's tokenomics and DAO can be found in Nela's Whitepaper and further details to be released soon._
