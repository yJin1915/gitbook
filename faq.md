<details>

<summary>Is Nela decentralized storage?</summary>

Yes and no. Nela itself is a decentralized ownership infrastructure, it comprises a set of components, some concerning file security and digital rights management and others concerning asset storage and asset delivery. Decentralized storage is only a component of Nela’s infrastructure.

<summary>Why are there components on the kernel layer of the operating system?</summary>

A wide range of existing software has been designed and implemented to edit and parse a multitude of digital file formats for desktop and mobile terminals. It is unrealistic to require legacy systems and file formats to adapt in accordance to the requirements of the blockchain. To provide security for all file type and application standards, encryption and decryption must occur in the operating system.

By combining the operating system with the decentralized blockchain network, file owners can have full control over the entire life-cycle (creation, distribution, usage, and destruction) of their digital assets.

<summary>What value does integrating Nela into a DApp provide?</summary>

No solution currently exists that provides the level of monetization flexibility and asset security that Nela provides. Digital asset rental is possible, adding additional revenue streams to NFT asset owners, whether time based rental, PPV, and even renting out of redistribution rights. Because the file is encrypted even during use and its access control is governed by the blockchain, digital asset owners can guarantee that access will be revoked at the end of the rental period and that plaintext can never be obtained by the end user, protecting the owner’s intellectual property from abuse.

<summary>What options are there for DApp developers to incorporate Nela’s functionality?</summary>

Nela’s SDK is modular and calls to the network are HTTP based. At its most basic level, traditional websites can incorporate Nela’s access control functionality through a simple library and webpage. As long as the user has the Nela Wallet application, all of Nela's functionality can be harnessed.

Without relying on Nela's Wallet application, DApp developers can integrate the different security modules directly.

Nela’s SDK provides the Local Service module. Local Service can be incorporated straight into DApps developed using the standard webapp stack. User’s downloading these DApps will be able to use Nela’s full functionality for files accessible through the DApp.

For the full effects of IP protection, DApp developers can incorporate the DSFS (Decentralized Secure Real-Time File System) and Security Sandbox modules to provide protection at the kernel layer of the operating system. With this, users will be able to use any type of file with any native software without the ability to duplicate or abuse the asset (a .psd file can be opened with Photoshp, a .mp4 with VLC, etc.).

<details>

<summary>Is Nela’s solution only fit for NFT owners?</summary>

No. Nela is a decentralized ownership solution and live distribution network. Sophisticated but easy-to-use monetization strategies make it a prime tool to expand what owners are able to do with their NFTs.&#x20;

Keeping this in mind, since Nela provides a commercial grade, high-speed decentralized storage and delivery network, Nela is prime infrastructure for decentralized websites, games and general digital file delivery.

<details>

<summary>Is Nela an NFT trading platform?</summary>

No. Nela is not directly comparable to OpenSea or any other NFT trading platform, it is a developer tool at its core. Any NFT trading platform can easily integrate Nela's functionality, just as some integrate IPFS or Arweave as an option for NFT asset storage. By choosing Nela, platforms can easily integrate monetization models such as asset rental and PPV directly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Which projects are competitors to Nela</summary>

There are no direct competitors to Nela. Although Nela provides decentralized storage, it is a decentralized ownership solution. Nela is an infrastructure solution for digital asset security, delivery and monetization, not just storage.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Which blockchains does Nela support?</summary>

Nela provides its tools to NFTs which sit on other L1 chains through bridges. At first, Nela will support native Nela NFTs, NEAR NFTs, Ethereum NFTs and Solana NFTs with the plans to develop additional bridges in the future.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What file types are supported by Nela?</summary>

Nela supports digital assets of any type across any application. Source code, documents, media, VR experiences, game files, websites and datasets are all supported along with all their native applications.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is the speed on Nela?</summary>

Nela's storage is optimized for both speed and scalable access-control. With the addition of DSCAN (decentralized CDN) directly to the storage network, Nela offers a commercial-grade experience capable of streaming high-bandwidth content such as 4K video streams and fully decentralized websites.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can Nela protect actions such as "Save as"?</summary>

Yes. With the security sandbox and real-time security kernel modules, any unpermissioned operations on encrypted files will be detected and redirected to the encrypted version of the file. When duplicates are made, they too will be encrypted versions of the file and will therefore still be protected by the asset's owner.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the current progress of Nela?</summary>

Development is complete. Nela is currently going through internal stress testing and is set to release a public test-net for developers by July 2022.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is the Nela network self-sustaining?</summary>

Digital asset commerce is at the heart of the Nela network. Nela's economy is supported through its native token NEL which serves both as a utility and governance token. Demand for NEL is derived from the growth and utility of the network, users require NEL to access its utility and participate in asset commerce. Resource providers are incentivized through mining rewards emitted from the network as well as upload fees on digital assets and a percentage of the commerce that flows through the network.

Mining rewards are built to sustain the network in the short term. Eventually, infrastructure will be self-sustained as commerce on the network grows and the ecosystem develops.

<details>

<summary>On what chain will the NEL token be minted?</summary>

NEL will be minted as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.
