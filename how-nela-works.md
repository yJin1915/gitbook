# How Nela Works

Nela is a multicomponent solution that provides decentralized storage, fast distribution, sophisticated monetization models and full IP security for all digital files.

The approach for file security on Nela is novel - **security and permissions are on the file level.**  Every file on Nela is encrypted client side along with information on all identities who have access and permissions on the file.

Encrypted files are then uploaded to Nela's decentralized storage network. Anyone can download encrypted files directly off of the network, but as long as their addresses are not permissioned to access or use the data, they cannot do anything with the file.

Once encrypted files are uploaded to the network, their access and permissions can be modified through smart contracts. With the high degree of permission specificity, subscription based access, time-based rental, pay-per-view, and rental of redistribution rights are all possible and are executed in a trust-less manner.

<summary>Benefit from increased delivery performance.</summary>

Nela's decentralized CDN (DSCAN) is directly integrated to the storage layer of the network, providing fast HTTP access compatible with any device and huge performance increase on file delivery. By acting as a cacheing layer for Nela, popular files can be serviced in a scalable manner across the network.

<summary>Integrate Nela compatibility with any application.</summary>

Nela's SDK and suite of modules allows for developers to integrate compatibility of encrypted files client side. Whether for use within a WebApp, for compatibility with the file's native applications (e.g. ps files on Photoshop), or for basic functionality within a website, developers can pick and choose which parts of Nela's SDK fit their use case and platform.

On the user side, DApps which integrate Nela's SDK will allow for the use of encrypted files by permissioned users on the client side whilst enforcing all protection set by the file's owner (e.g. protection from duplication and subsequent sharing). The file stays encrypted through usage, meaning that users cannot access the plaintext of the file at any point if not permissioned.

The Nela network is an encrypted decentralized file system, where protection and delivery performance of files is of the highest priority.&#x20;
