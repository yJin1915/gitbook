# The Vision

Today, an oligopoly of trillion-dollar-companies maintains an effective toll system on the digital roads. The rise of these giants was fueled by a digital revolution; in one generation, digital-files have simultaneously replaced paper, films, records, and tapes; making digital-files the most successful information-medium in human history. Each of us owns thousands of files, and in a very real way our entire lives are now stored on countless digital-files that travel across the internet. The fact that all of these files are stored, managed and protected by a handful of mega-corporation gives them enormous amounts of power and control. In a single decision, a business can be crippled, social accounts can be closed, personal data abused and the ability to be paid online terminated.

The allure of decentralized technology is in its promise to change the rules of the game.

Imagine if a digital creator could sell, or rent her work, deliver it directly to customers and get paid, all without the need for any centralized platform to broker the exchange, all while preserving privacy, and transparency?

Nela will provide ways for businesses and developers to create, host and operate trustless services for the sale, licensing, distribution, and protection of any digital product, all without any intermediate party, and in a trust-less manner. Giving back total ownership and control to digital asset owners.

Built from the ground up around privacy, security, interoperability, and performance - blockchain and distributed ledger technology are key components in Nela’s unique value proposition. Blockchain provides the technical foundation for Nela’s Encrypted Decentralized File System (EDFS), an infrastructure that can be trusted to allow apps to share files while retaining file ownership and control. Nela’s EDFS guarantees the security, anonymity, and integrity of files shared between two or more parties.

**The core concept of Nela is that files remain encrypted. Even after they are downloaded.**

Nela’s EDFS protocol separates the notion of having the bytes of a file, from the notion of having access to it. Nela’s decentralized security eliminates the need for regulating access to the bytes of a file (paywalls, firewalls, 2FA), instead, Nela's files are self-securing in-place.

In practical terms, revoking access to an online video works for all its circulating copies, its downloaded copies too.

This capability is revolutionary from the perspective of privacy and security and it is a necessary aspect for the open, user owned web, as one of the primary premises of the decentralized web is to use technology and not litigation, smart contracts and not paper contracts. Through file transactions in Nela, permissions and pricing can all be programmed into self contained smart-contracts. It goes even deeper, Nela’s smart-contracts can enforce file access to a specific operating system or hardware requirement, all without usernames, passwords or API keys. Our guiding principle is that Web3 should surpass what Web2 has to offer not just philosophically and ethically, but also technically and practically. One should be able to do more, in a simpler, more affordable way.

Programmable security empowers artists, creators, musicians, and filmmakers, but also owners of private documents, creators of source code and owners of datasets. It enables them to protect their assets and realize their value without relying on any centralized entity. Direct P2P licensing is a new way of sharing and doing business, and we believe it will promote more freedom, more creativity, and even protect the personal security of creators in places where free expression is curtailed or dangerous.

We also see great potential for Nela as an enterprise solution, security and file protection are in high demand and are a ubiquitous requirement for any computer system. Decentralized security and decentralized file protection can fundamentally change how data is traded, how files are shared, and how businesses protect their intellectual property.

We believe that every file has value, practical, commercial or sentimental, and because of that, all files should be protected. We are providing the infrastructure for files to realize their value. Nela enables a future where complete ownership, control and security of all intellectual property is in the hands of the owner, and it does so in a trust-less manner. There is no need for a middleman.
