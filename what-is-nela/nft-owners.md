# NFT Owners

At Nela, we believe that in order to ensure the longevity of NFTs and their mainstream adoption into other industries and domains beyond digital collectibles, we must address the following problems of NFT-backed assets.

<details>

<summary>Immutability</summary>

NFTs are only an ownership record system, they only maintain a link. Underlying assets must be stored off-chain. If the original file uploader can change the underlying asset (“pulling the rug”), the NFT loses its value. It is therefore crucial that the off-chain assets are immutable so that secondary owners of the NFT maintain the asset they originally purchased.

<summary><strong>Permanency</strong></summary>

NFT assets are stored off-chain, in some instances on decentralized storage and in others on centralized alternatives. In most cases, permanent storage requires the original uploader to support the storage of the file. Whatever the case may be, it is critical that NFT assets are permanently available online, losing access to an asset renders the NFT valueless.

<summary>Performance</summary>

For NFTs to gain mainstream adoption, it is crucial that their storage and delivery are comparable to that of the status quo. That means, high-speed download/upload in order to support high-performance applications such as 4K streaming, gaming and VR. Additionally infrastructure must be able to cater to any file type and file size.

<summary>Security &#x26; Access Control</summary>

Owners of digital assets should have total control over their assets. This means, control over who can access them, the ability to revoke access, and also control over the different permissions people are granted (the extent of use, distribution, duplication, etc.). This is especially important for assets which are not meant to be public as opposed to digital collectibles, it is more apparent in cases such as private data, high-effort art such as music and movies, and legal documents.

<summary>Flexible Monetization</summary>

Perhaps the greatest barrier to entry of NFTs into other commercial domains is the lack of tools to execute many real-world business-model specific monetization. To address this, infrastructure must cater towards time-based rental, subscription based use, pay-per-view, and pay-per-listen monetization models on assets. Expanding NFTs into new domains requires having more than just the standard ownership transfer.

<summary>Digital Rights Management</summary>

Protecting assets at the end-user side is a vital aspect of content distribution. High-value content requires protection from piracy, duplication, and IP theft. In order to truly realize the value of digital assets, their content must be resistant to abuse.

</details>

By providing a solution which addresses all of the above, Nela sets the infrastructure to expand the use cases of NFTs. Through this, many domains can cater for true digital asset ownership and control without compromising their domain-specific practices.
