# Web3 Infrastructure

**Nela as a solution for true digital asset ownership is also a cornerstone to realizing the vision of Web3.** By combining commercial-grade performance with trust-less ownership and control for any type of digital file, Nela enables the foundation of an internet in which all aspects are owned and controlled by its users. Whether it is your private social media data, personal documents, media files, code repositories, or a website, every aspect of the web is not only owned by someone, but is under total control of its owner and subject to any type of monetization strategy to realize its value.

NFTs are a useful aspect of digital asset commerce, but Nela goes even further. As an encrypted decentralized file system, Nela also sets a framework for secured and permissioned file-drives and completely decentralized platforms.&#x20;
