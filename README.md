# What is Nela?

You can upload any file you have created to Nela for safekeeping. All the files uploaded to Nela are encrypted, so you are the only one who can use them by default.

You can share any file stored on Nela with individuals, groups, or the public, and you can do so in a trust-less manner via wallet addresses; no usernames, emails, or passwords are needed. In addition, every file on Nela has a blockchain record in the form of an NFT that allows for operations like sharing to be programmed into smart contracts and carry fees so that you can rent, sell or buy files directly on Nela from your computer. No intermediary is needed.

But it goes further than that; Nela makes the creation of smart contracts for licensing trivial. Creating and enforcing sophisticated pricing models for files is fundamental to intellectual-property transactions. You may sell art, share code, license content, or purchase data. File-driven transactions are at the base of our digital economy; Nela makes these transactions secure, trust-less, programmable, and automatic.
